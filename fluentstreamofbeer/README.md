Thirsty? Well, you are in the right place! Welcome to:

(Fluent)Stream O' Beer

Sales Pitch: 
You seem thirsty, like not just a little thirsty, but like walk-through-the-desert-for-a-month kinda thirsty. Well, you have made it to Juliettes cooler, the place where you can reach those dehydrated fingers in and pull out a frothy beer. Forget the water, Juliette's cooler has lite beer chilled and ready to crack open. But wait.. what if you checked the cooler and only find Pabst BUT you're NOT a hipster? Well, just type in a new beer and within a moment's time, Juliette's magical cooler is populated with your favorite beer. 

But wait... what happens if you grab a beer that you can't live without but you're afraid that you may forget the name (thanks to a healthy indulgence)? Well, you're in luck because of the "Like" button tracking system. Now you can add (or subtract) the amount of likes you have for each beer.
